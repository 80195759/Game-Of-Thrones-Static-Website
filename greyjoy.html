  <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center w3-text-white">The Greyjoys</h2>
  <p class="w3-opacity w3-center w3-text-white"><i>We Do Not Sow</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify w3-text-white">House Greyjoy of Pyke is one of the Great Houses of Westeros. It rules over the Iron Islands, a harsh and bleak collection of islands off the west coast of Westeros, from the castle at Pyke. The head of the house is the Lord Reaper of Pyke.

House Greyjoy's sigil is traditionally a golden kraken on a black field. Their house words are "We Do Not Sow," although the phrase "What Is Dead May Never Die" is also closely associated with House Greyjoy and their bannermen, as they are associated with the faith of the Drowned God.

House Greyjoy had been in open rebellion against the Iron Throne since the War of the Five Kings, during which it sought independence for the Iron Islands once more. However, following the death of King Balon Greyjoy and the election of his brother, Euron, as the new King of the Iron Islands, House Greyjoy was divided between Euron and his followers, and Balon's surviving children, Yara and Theon, and their followers. Yara's faction, which had aligned with House Targaryen, was defeated by Euron, who has aligned himself with House Lannister upon the beginning of Daenerys Targaryen's invasion of Westeros.</p>

<h2 class="w3-wide w3-text-white">CURRENT STATUS</h2>
<p class="w3-justify w3-text-white">At the invitation of the newly-crowned Queen Cersei Lannister, Euron travels to King's Landing with his portion of the Iron Fleet. In response to the threat of Queen Daenerys, Euron and Cersei form a pact to kill their estranged relatives Yara, Theon, and Tyrion Lannister, who have sided with Dany. Jaime Lannister distrusts Euron due to the historical enmity between the Greyjoys and Lannisters during the Greyjoy Rebellion. Cersei turns down Euron's marriage offer since she distrusts the Lord Reaper of Pyke. Euron promises to return with a gift.

Later, Princess Yara attends Queen Dany's war council at Dragonstone castle. She advocates attacking King's Landing immediately but settles for Tyrion's plan to use her faction of the Iron Fleet to transport Dornishmen and House Tyrell forces across the Narrow Sea to lay siege to King's Landing. While traveling through the high seas with Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes, Yara's fleet is ambushed by Euron's fleet. Euron's forces wipe out Yara's Ironborn faction and captures Yara, Ellaria, and her daughter Tyene Sand. Theon manages to escape by jumping into the sea and clinging to driftwood.

Following the assault on the Targaryen fleet, Theon is rescued from the sea by the Ironborn crew of one of the few Yara-loyalist ships to have survived the battle. Theon claims that he tried to rescue his sister but the crew realize he is lying. Meanwhile, Euron leads his niece Yara along with Ellaria and Tyene through the streets of King's Landing. Euron is greeted as a hero while Yara is pelted with rotten fruit by the smallfolk. At the Red Keep, Yara is taken into custody while Euron is appointed as the commander of Queen Cersei's naval forces. Jaime however opines that Euron's head belongs on a spike and reacts negatively when Euron asks about having sex with Cersei. Euron later leads the Iron Fleet in attacking the Unsullied forces that have attacked Casterly Rock, the seat of House Lannister</p>
