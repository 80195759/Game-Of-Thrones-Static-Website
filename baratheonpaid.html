  <p class="w3-opacity w3-center w3-text-white">Ours Is The Fury<i></i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify w3-text-white">House Baratheon of Storm's End is a legally extinct Great House of Westeros. A cadet branch was formerly the royal house, but House Lannister now controls the throne. House Baratheon traditionally ruled the Stormlands on the eastern coast of Westeros, aptly named for its frequent storms, from their seat of Storm's End.

House Baratheon became the royal house of the Seven Kingdoms after Robert Baratheon led a rebellion against the Targaryen dynasty. At the end of the rebellion, Robert ascended the Iron Throne as Robert I and married Cersei Lannister after the death of Lyanna Stark.

House Baratheon's sigil is a black stag on a gold background and their house words are "Ours Is the Fury." When Robert ascended to the Iron Throne, a gold crown was added to the stag, denoting their status as the royal house.

House Baratheon is now legally extinct, but the family bloodline lives on through Gendry, a bastard son of Robert Baratheon and the last living person with true blood ties to the Baratheon family.</p>

<h2 class="w3-wide w3-text-white">CURRENT STATUS</h2>
<p class="w3-justify w3-text-white">When Daenerys Targaryen sends her Hand, Tyrion Lannister, to King's Landing to negotiate with his brother Jaime Lannister, Ser Davos Seaworth, who smuggles in Tyrion, travels to Flea Bottom. At the Street of Steel, Davos finds the unrecognized bastard Gendry, the last living person with Baratheon blood through his father, Robert Baratheon. Gendry recognizes Davos and agrees to accompany him back to Dragonstone, expressing his disgust over forcibly forging armor and swords for the Lannisters, who killed his father and his family and tried to kill him. Gendry brings with him a war hammer with the Baratheon sigil emblazened on it, similar to the one his father Robert famously used during Robert's Rebellion and the Greyjoy Rebellion. Gendry uses the hammer to kill two gold cloaks that recognize Tyrion. Back at Dragonstone, Davos tells Gendry to keep his identity a secret, but Gendry immediately introduces himself to Jon Snow, the new King in the North, as Robert Baratheon's bastard son. The two bastards get along well, reminiscing over their fathers (Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark, unaware that Jon is actually the son of Rhaegar Targaryen, whom Robert killed at the Battle of the Trident). Just as Robert and Ned fought together, Gendry agrees to fight with Jon and accompanies him to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea in his mission to capture a wight to prove the existence and return of the White Walkers. At Eastwatch, Gendry warns Jon not to trust the Brotherhood Without Banners but Jon says that they are all on the same side because they're "all breathing."

Gendry
Gendry fights against a wight.
Beyond the Wall, Gendry asks the wildling Tormund how he kept himself warm, stating that he's never seen snow before. When Tormund jokingly alludes to needing to have sex with Gendry in order to keep warm, the disturbed Gendry falls back. He confronts Beric Dondarrion and Thoros over selling him to Melisandre when Gendry tried to join the Brotherhood years back, but Sandor Clegane tells Gendry to quit his whinging. Thoros offers Gendry rum, which Gendry drinks. Later, after successfully capturing a wight, Jon has Gendry run back to Eastwatch when that wight attracts the attention of hundreds of more wights. Tormund forces Gendry to leave behind his war hammer. Gendry makes it back to Eastwatch nearly exhausted, where he has Ser Davos send a raven to Dragonstone asking Daenerys for help.</p>
