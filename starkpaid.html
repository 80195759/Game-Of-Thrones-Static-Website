  <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center w3-text-white">THE STARKS</h2>
  <p class="w3-opacity w3-center w3-text-white"><i>Winter Is Coming</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify w3-text-white">House Stark of Winterfell is a Great House of Westeros, ruling over the vast region known as the North and the Vale as Kings in the North from their seat in Winterfell, recently retaken by the Starks from House Bolton. It is by far one of the oldest lines of Westerosi nobility, claiming a line of descent stretching back over eight thousand years. The head of the house is the Lord of Winterfell. Before the Targaryen conquest, the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the Kings in the North. Jon Snow is the current King in the North and the Vale, partially due to the allegiance of Petyr Baelish, the Lord Regent of the Vale, to House Stark.</p>

<h2 class="w3-wide w3-text-white">CURRENT STATUS</h2>
<p class="w3-justify w3-text-white">The current status of the surviving Starks and what political positions they hold is not fully clear, after Jon Snow was hailed as the new King in the North by not only the lords of the North but the Vale as well (and presumably, the lords of the Riverlands will join them again with House Frey's rule collapsing).

Jon Snow is believed to be Eddard Stark's bastard son, which means he should have ranked behind Sansa Stark in line of succession - though if he legitimizes himself that would put him ahead of Sansa (though of course, the line of succession is ultimately words on paper).

Moreover, Eddard's last trueborn son Bran Stark is actually still alive, and heading back south of the Wall. It has never been legally clear if an older legitimized bastard should outrank a younger lawfully born son or not (many civil wars have resulted from this type of situation); nor is it clear if the lords of the North would follow Bran, given that he is a cripple who cannot walk while Jon Snow personally led them to victory in battle.

In secret, all of these assumptions are incorrect - as Bran recently discovered in a vision - because in truth Jon Snow is actually the son of Eddard's younger sister, Lyanna Stark, and according to the normal line of succession would rank behind both Bran and Sansa (even if he was legitimate), while at the same time his true status as the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar Targaryen potentially makes him heir to the Iron Throne itself. Howland Reed, Eddard's only surviving companion from the Showdown at the Tower of Joy, may be able to confirm Jon's parentage.

The situation is simply unclear, and will probably change drastically when Bran Stark returns south of the Wall - not only because he is Eddard's last trueborn son but because he bears the revelation about Jon Snow's true parentage.

Jon's original intention before being declared the new King in the North was for Sansa to be the next "Lady of Winterfell" (and apparently Queen in the North) - and the HBO Viewer's Guide still labels Sansa as "Lady of Winterfell". Given that both the Vale and possibly the Riverlands are now also supporting Jon Snow as the new King in the North, he now rules a much larger portion of Westeros overall, not just "The North", in effect a rival northern realm to the one ruled from King's Landing.

While the exact details haven't been worked out yet, it appears that Jon Snow will rule as the new "King in the North", but in parallel to the Lords Paramount who rule southern kingdoms under the Iron Throne, three other lords under him rule sub-regions in his new kingdom: Sansa Stark ruling Winterfell and possibly "the North" overall, Sweetrobin Arryn ruling the Vale, and the captured Edmure Tully nominally ruling the Riverlands.

All of this will be subject to change anyway when Bran Stark returns in the near future.</p>
