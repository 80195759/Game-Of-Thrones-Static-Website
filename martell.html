  <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center w3-text-white">The Martells</h2>
  <p class="w3-opacity w3-center w3-text-white">Unbowed Unbent Unbroken<i></i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify w3-text-white">House Martell of Sunspear is a legally extinct Great House of Westeros. It ruled the peninsula of Dorne in the far south of the continent from their castle Sunspear. Though loyal to the Iron Throne, the Martells were never conquered by the Targaryens and pursued a more isolated role in wider political events since Robert's Rebellion.

House Martell's sigil is a red sun pierced by a golden spear, on an orange field, a combination of the original Martell sigil - a yellow spear - and the emblem of Princess Nymeria - a red sun - to symbolize the marriage of the warrior-queen to Mors Martell. Their house words are "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken."

With the assassinations of Prince Doran Martell and his only heir, Prince Trystane, by Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes, House Martell is legally extinct, although the Sand Snakes themselves carry Martell blood through their father Oberyn. The Sand Snakes also continue to use the Martell sigil to represent themselves and Dorne.

Under the leadership of Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes, the forces of House Martell and Dorne have aligned to support the cause of Daenerys Targaryen, against House Lannister after they declared war against them. With the deaths of the older Sand Snakes and Ellaria's sentence to life in prison, House Martell's future is uncertain.

<h2 class="w3-wide w3-text-white">CURRENT STATUS</h2>
<p class="w3-justify w3-text-white">Ellaria and the oldest three Sand Snakes arrive at Dragonstone and hold council with Daenerys and her court, where a plan is laid out on how best to deal with Cersei and her allies. The Martells are taken by Yara and the Ironborn fleet to return to Dorne, where they will gather their armies and prepare to lay seige to King's Landing along with the Tyrell armies. En route, however, the Ironborn ships are attacked by Euron Greyjoy and his new fleet. When Euron's lead ship, Silence, crashes into Yara's flagship, Black Wind, his crew boards her ship and begins fighting. Tyene and Ellaria Sand are both captured, while Obara and Nymeria are each killed with their own weapons at Euron's own hands. The sisters are attached to the bowsprit of the ship before Silence departs, leaving Black Wind to burn.

Ellaria and Tyene are paraded through the streets of King's Landing, where they are jeered and pelted with rotten fruits by the smallfolk. The mother and daughter are brought before Queen Cersei Lannister, who thanks Euron for delivering her "justice". Later, Cersei takes Ellaria and Tyene to the dungeons beneath the Red Keep and has them gagged and chained up. As punishment for the murder of her daughter Myrcella Baratheon, Cersei kisses Tyene with the Long farewell and forces Ellaria to watch as her daughter succumbs to the poison. Cersei taunts Ellaria that she will spend the rest of her days in the dungeons watching her daughter's corpse rotting.</p>
