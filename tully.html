  <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center w3-text-white">The Tullys</h2>
  <p class="w3-opacity w3-center w3-text-white"><i>Family Duty Honor</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify w3-text-white">House Tully of Riverrun is an exiled Great House of Westeros. Its most senior member carried the title of Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Trident, until the Red Wedding. The current head is Lord Edmure Tully, son of the late Hoster Tully. The Tully sigil is a silver trout on a red and blue background. Their house words are "Family, Duty, Honor."

At the onset of the War of the Five Kings, House Tully came under attack by House Lannister and lent its support for House Stark when they came to their aid in the liberation of the Riverlands. House Tully has since been formally stripped of lands and titles for rebellion against the Iron Throne, with Lord Edmure a captive of House Frey following the Red Wedding. 

Later, Ser Brynden Tully gathered the remaining Tully forces and reclaimed Riverrun from the Freys, reopening conflict between the Tullys and the Iron Throne. The Freys lay siege to Riverrun, and were later assisted by the Lannisters on the orders of King Tommen I. Ser Jaime Lannister managed to end the siege by convincing Edmure Tully to command the garrison to lay down their weapons in return for clemency and protection. Brynden was killed during a final stand with Lannister and Frey forces while Edmure was returned to the Freys as a prisoner.</p>

<h2 class="w3-wide w3-text-white">CURRENT STATUS</h2>
<p class="w3-justify w3-text-white">After the Red Wedding saw the capture of Lord Edmure Tully and the granting of Riverrun to House Frey, only Lord Tully's uncle Brynden the 'Blackfish' remained at large. Although Walder Frey had dismissed Roose Bolton's concerns about his escape after the massacre, the Blackfish proved a challenge to the Freys' newly acquired control over the Riverlands. He assembled what remained of the Tully armies still loyal to his House, and was able to retake Riverrun from the Freys, challenging both them and the Lannisters who supported them.

Lord Petyr Baelish told Sansa Stark, a Tully kinsman by her mother Catelyn, of Brynden's actions as she was looking for supporters to help her and her brother Jon Snow overthrow House Bolton. Sansa sent her bodyguard Brienne of Tarth to Riverrun to meet with her great-uncle and gain his support in reclaiming the North.

News of the Blackfish's recapture of Riverrun infuriates Lord Walder Frey, who chastises his sons Lothar and Black Walder for letting Brynden escape the Red Wedding. In an attempt to force Brynden to surrender, Lord Frey orders his sons to bring his captive nephew Edmure to Riverrun as a hostage. The Freys besiege Riverrun and force Edmure to wear a noose during the siege. Lothar and Black Walder threaten to kill Edmure but Brynden is not intimidated by their antics; knowing that they will not carry out their threats. The Freys are relieved by Lannister forces under a Ser Jaime Lannister, who has come on behalf of the Iron Throne to take control of the siege.

Jaime also orders the Freys to wash and feed the dishevelled Edmure. When Black Walder protests, Jaime strikes him across the face and warns him that he is now in command of the siege of Riverrun. Jaime later parleys with the Blackfish in an attempt to end the siege peacefully. Jaime offers to spare the life of his men but warns that the Lannisters will slaughter everyone inside the castle. Undaunted, Brynden tells Jaime that Riverrun has enough food to last two years and thousands of Lannisters will die for the hundreds inside his walls. Unimpressed by Jaime, Brynden rejects his terms.

With Jaime's consent, Brienne attempts to convince the Blackfish to evacuate the castle. Jaime has agreed to allow Brynden and the garrison to vacate the castle by nightfall in order to aid Sansa and Jon against the Boltons. Unwilling to abandon his home and lacking the manpower to help the Starks, the Blackfish declines Brienne and Jaime's offer. Running out of options, Jaime convinces Edmure to command the garrison to surrender in return for clemency and his son getting a proper education at Casterly Rock, the Lannister seat. As an added incentive, Jaime threatens to destroy the entire castle and to catapult Edmure's son over the wall should he decline the ultimatum. With little choice, Edmure consents to this deal.

Edmure returns to Riverrun and gains admission into the castle despite Brynden's objections. Once inside, the garrison recognizes Edmure as the rightful Lord of Riverrun. Edmure then orders the Tully troops to surrender and allow Lannister and Frey forces to occupy the castle. He also gives orders for his uncle to be put into chains and handed over to the Freys. However, Brynden helps Brienne and Podrick escape the castle on a boat and then makes a final stand against the Lannisters and Freys. Ser Jaime is informed of the Blackfish's death. Shortly thereafter, however, Edmure's niece Arya Stark avenges the Starks and Tullys by murdering Walder Frey and his sons, Lothar and Black Walder.</p>
