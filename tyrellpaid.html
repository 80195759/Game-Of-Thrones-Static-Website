  <p class="w3-opacity w3-center w3-text-white">Growing Strong<i></i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify w3-text-white">House Tyrell of Highgarden is an extinct Great House of Westeros. It ruled over the Reach, a vast, fertile, and heavily-populated region of southwestern Westeros, from their castle-seat, Highgarden. The House was formerly led by Lord Mace Tyrell. Mace's son Loras was a noted tournament knight (and, secretly, the lover of Lord Renly Baratheon). Mace's daughter Margaery married Renly when he crowned himself king, to cement the alliance between Renly and her father. Following Renly's death, Margaery was then married to King Joffrey Baratheon before his assassination at his wedding feast. She was then married to his younger brother, King Tommen Baratheon. Mace's mother, the indomitable Olenna Tyrell assumed House Tyrell's lordship after Margaery Tyrell, Loras Tyrell, and Mace Tyrell were all killed by wildfire during the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor. Under Lady Olenna, House Tyrell had aligned itself with House Targaryen in opposition against Queen Cersei I for orchestrating the demise of most of the main branch of the Tyrell family. With the death of Lady Olenna after the Sack of Highgarden, the House has officially become extinct.

The Tyrell sigil is a golden rose on a pale green field. Their house words are "Growing Strong."</p>

<h2 class="w3-wide w3-text-white">CURRENT STATUS</h2>
<p class="w3-justify w3-text-white">As a member of the Dragon Queen Daenerys Targaryen's alliance, Lady Olenna attends a war council in the Chamber of the Painted Table at Dragonstone. When Queen Daenerys remarks that she does not want to become the "Queen of Ashes", Lady Tyrell responds that Queen Cersei will not give up the Iron Throne easily and makes references to the death of her grand daughter Margaery at the Great Sept of Baelor. At the advice of her Hand Tyrion Lannister, Dany approves a plan to use House Tyrell and Dornishmen to lay siege to King's Landing.

Following the meeting, the Dragon Queen summons Lady Olenna for a private meeting and tells her that she is aware that her motives are based on revenge rather than love for her. When Dany insists that she will usher in an era of peace, Olenna counters that there never really was a lasting peace under the Mad King or any preceding Targaryen. She warns Daenerys that Tyrion is a clever man and that Olenna has outlasted many clever men by not listening to their advice. She likens the lords of Westeros to sheep and tells Dany that she must be a dragon if she wants to rule Westeros.

Meanwhile, Queen Cersei summons Lord Randyll Tarly, one of House Tyrell's vassals, and attempts to convince him to cast aside his allegiance to House Tyrell. Despite Cersei's warnings about the threat of Daenerys and her Dothraki hordes, Lord Tarly is reluctant to abandon his loyalty to Lady Olenna due to his distrust of the Lannisters. Jaime Lannister however convinces Lord Tarly to reconsider by painting Cersei as the lesser evil and offers to make him the warden of the south.

703 Tyrell Casualties
The overwhelmed Tyrell forces.
Whilst the Unsullied take Casterly Rock from House Lannister, Jaime Lannister, along with Bronn, Dickon, and Randyll Tarly, lead the combined forces of the Lannister and Tarly armies in an assault on Highgarden, the seat of House Tyrell. Left largely undefended, the castle is taken quickly despite the garrison's spirited defense and lost to the Lannisters. Jaime Lannister gives Olenna Tyrell, the last remaining Tyrell of the main branch, poison which she chooses to willingly drink. Olenna's death is a blow to the Targaryen cause, as well as extinguishing the main branch of House Tyrell, and losing their ancestral seat of Highgarden.

The Iron Throne seizes House Tyrell's assets to pay their debts to the Iron Bank of Braavos. House Tarly's betrayal of the Tyrells allows them to usurp them as the Great House of the Reach and Wardens of the South. However, before she dies, Lady Olenna reveals to Jaime Lannister that she was the one who poisoned his and Cersei's son Joffrey at the Purple Wedding and requests that this be passed on to Cersei; a last little gift from House Tyrell.

Tyrion Lannister makes it clear to Randyll Tarly that Cersei isn't the right choice for Westeros, as she destroyed House Tyrell (Randyll's liege lords) for good, before he is executed by Drogon on Daenerys Targaryen's orders. Thus, in combination with Jaime Lannister's words about Olenna's House having been destroyed, it is made clear that House Tyrell is no more.</p>
