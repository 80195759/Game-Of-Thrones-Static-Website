  <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center w3-text-white">The Lannisters</h2>
  <p class="w3-opacity w3-center w3-text-white"><i>Hear Me Roar</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify w3-text-white">House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of Westeros, one of its richest and most powerful families and oldest dynasties. It is also the current royal house of the Seven Kingdoms following the extinction of House Baratheon of King's Landing, which had been their puppet house anyway.

The Lannisters rule over the Westerlands. Their seat is Casterly Rock, a massive rocky promontory overlooking the Sunset Sea which has had habitations and fortifications built into it over the millennia. They are the Lords Paramount of the Westerlands and Wardens of the West. As the new royal house, they also rule directly over the Crownlands from their seat of the Red Keep in King's Landing, the traditional seat of the royal family. House Lannister's Heraldry consists of a golden lion on a crimson background, and their House words are "Hear me roar!", which is rarely mentioned. Their unofficial motto, which is as well known as the official one, is "A Lannister always pays his debts" - which is used much more often and mostly in negative context, though it can also be used in the original, literal sense.

The incestuous relationship of Cersei and Jaime has been concealed in a conspiracy. Their son Joffrey Baratheon has claimed the Iron Throne on the premise that he was actually fathered by the late King Robert Baratheon. Lord Tywin was a key supporter of his reign in the War of the Five Kings.</p>

<h2 class="w3-wide w3-text-white">CURRENT STATUS</h2>
<p class="w3-justify w3-text-white">Cersei and Jaime discuss their strategy and their enemies. Jaime points out their lack of allies and questions Cersei's power. He expresses his will to discuss Tommen's suicide, but she refuses calling their youngest children a traitor. She later reveals that she has considered a new ally, Euron Greyjoy. Euron arrives to ask Cersei to marriage, but she denies stating that she cannot trust him. Jaime then reminisces about Euron's primary role in the Greyjoy Rebellion, including the Sack of Lannisport and is less then impressed when Euron proposes to Cersei, but is relieved when she refuses his proposal.

In response to the threat of the Dragon Queen Daenerys, Queen Cersei summons Lord Randyll Tarly and other noblemen from the Reach. Using the threat of Daenerys and her Dothraki hordes, Jaime attempts to convince Lord Tarly and his fellow lords to cast aside their allegiance to their liege lord Lady Olenna Tyrell, who has sided with Daenerys. Lord Tarly is reluctant to do so due to his distrust of Cersei. However, Jaime convinces him that Cersei is the "lesser of the two evils" and offers him a position as a general. Later, Maester Qyburn presents a scorpion to Cersei, which he claims can neutralize Dany's dragons. The Queen tests the weapon on the skull of Balerion the Black Dread.

A vast Lannister army of 10,000 men - containing most of the forces assembled by Tywin Lannister - abandons Casterly Rock on Queen Cersei's orders. Instead of defending the Lannister's ancient seat, they swoop down on the Tyrell seat Highgarden which they take with ease, thus eliminating House Tyrell and its forces. However, much of the Lannister army is later annihilated in a surprise ambush by Daenerys and her Dothraki horde.

After the battle, Daenerys rounds up the surviving Lannister soldiers, only a few dozen men. She attempts to persuade them that she is a just and gracious queen, causing some men to submit and kneel, though the majority stay silent and remain standing, defiantly. Drogon roars at the crowd of men, causing most to kneel, but some men remain standing, including Randyll and Dickon Tarly. Daenerys demands that Randyll bend the knee, but Randyll refuses, calling her a foreign invader with an army of savages. Daenerys orders Randyll to be burnt alive, but his son decides to die beside his father. Drogon breathes fire on the two men, quickly reducing them to piles of ash. The remaining Lannister men are terrified and bend the knee out of complete fear. Meanwhile, Jaime is saved from drowning by Bronn, and the two look over the charred battlefield and realize that the war is completely lost. Jaime returns to Kings's Landing and informs Cersei of the catastrophic casualties his army suffered. Cersei remains stubborn and states she will hire mercenaries to reinforce their armies. Jaime and Tyrion later meet up beneath the Red Keep and discuss a potential cease fire, though Jaime is still sour towards Tyrion for the death of their father. Cersei later reveals to Jamie that she is pregnant with their child and that she is no longer afraid to let her kingdom know of it.</p>
